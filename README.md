# robot-gladiators

// Game States  

// "WIN" - Player robot has defeated all enemy-robots  
//    * Fight all enemy-robots  
//    * Defeat each enemy-robot  
// "LOSE" - Player robot's health is zero or less  


//Adding restart ability and option to go shopping  

//Wrap the game logic in a startGame() Function  
//When the player is defeated or there are no more enemies, call an endGame() Function that:  
//  *Alerts the player's total stats  
//  *Ask the player if they want to play again  
//  *If yes, call startGame() to restart the game  
//After the player skips or defeats an enemy (and there are still more robots to fight):  
//  *Ask the player if they want to "shop"  
//  *If no, continue as normal  
//  *If yes, call the shop() Function  
//  *In the shop() Function, ask player if they want to "refill" health, "upgrade" attack, or "leave" the shop  
//  *If refill, subtract money points from player and increase health  
//  *If upgrade, subtract money pooints from player and increase attack power  
//  *If leave, alert goodbye and exit the function  
//  *If any other invalid option, call shop() again
